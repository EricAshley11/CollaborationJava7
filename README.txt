Project Tracker Version 1.0

Initial release of our Project Tracker application.
	Requires JRE 7 (Java Runtime Environment 7)

General Overview:
	Project Tracker was created to allow teams of agile developers to oversee their projects 
	and tasks. It is also a valuable tool for managers and project leads, as it allows them 
	to assign tasks to users and create deadlines for their teams. The Restlet library helps create 
	a RESTful environment, which allows multiple users to login at the same time and modify the 
	environment concurrently. The simple and intuitive graphical user interface makes using this
	application easy and fast, with a minimal learning curve. Project Tracker is integrated with
	popular online applications such as Google Calendar, GitHub and Toggl.

	Project Tracker is a lightweight, flexibile application with server integration that allows 
	project teams to coordinate effectively.
